	                         "instead the 'central brain' that does the spawning and designates where objects will spawn. " +
	                         "\n\n2. You can click 'Create Spawn Point' to quickly make a new Spawn Point." +
	                         "\n\n3. ALL Spawn Points must have a Spawner ID that matches their associated Quick Spawner's ID, otherwise they will not link. " +

	                         "\n\n5. Seconds Between Waves means how many seconds pass until a spawn is called. This means a message is sent to the available Spawn Points " +
	                         "to say 'It's time to spawn something!'.\nYou can add (or subtract) time from this with 'Add Time Between Waves'. " +
	                         "This will let you make spawn waves happen faster or slower over time. You can put a negative number in that field to reduce time between waves. " +
	                         "It will not go below 0.5 seconds." +
	                         "\n\n6. If you click the dropdown arrow next to 'Objects To Spawn' and change 'Size' 0 to 1 or more, you can drag and drop objects into these slots. " +
	                         "These are the objects the Quick Spawner will spawn at the Spawn Points.\nIf you add multiple objects to the list of Objects To Spawn, the Quick Spawner will spawn random selections from that list. To set up chance, " +
	                         "just add more or less of the same object." +
	                         "\n\nNOTE: The Quick Spawner will Instantiate objects. Please keep this in mind if building to a platform that runs on a lower processor. " +
	                         "Object pooling may be added in the future." +
